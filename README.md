# SentimentAnalysis
This code performs sentiment analysis on tweets. The training and testing data were retrieved from https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/si650winter11/data. NLPPickled.py trains machine learning classifiers with tweets marked as positive and negative. The accuracy of the classifiers after training is around 97%. sentiment_mod.py defines the sentiment function, which takes in a tweet and outputs the sentiment value and the confidence of that classification. These values are determined using a voting system among the classifiers. Finally, sentiment_analysis.py performs sentiment analysis on the test data, printing the tweet, its sentiment value, and its confidence score. Using tweepy, this code can also be used to stream tweets on a keyword and perform live sentiment analysis. For the purpose of keeping my API key private, I removed that part of the code. I followed along a tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLZvOKSCkxY&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDf2JswnfiGkliBInZnIC4HL to begin this project.
